*aiotasks: A Celery like task manager that distributes Asyncio coroutines*

What's aiotasks
---------------

aiotasks is an asynchronous & distributed task queue / jobs queue,
implemented as coroutines and based on Python asyncio framework.

Based on the Celery Task Queue ideas, but distributing coroutines and doing
focus in performance, non-blocking & event-driven concepts.

aiotasks doesn't pulling and doesn't has active waiting for incoming jobs,
instead use asyncio framework to suspend the execution until any new data
are received by a new broker notification.

.. note::

    aiotasks is still under development. Not as active as I would like (for
    time limitations), but the project is in active development.

    If you want to contribute, take a look to the TODO.md file.
